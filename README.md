# lmplement_Hebbian_learning_algorithm
🧠 Project Description

This project implements the Hebbian Learning Algorithm, one of the earliest and most fundamental learning rules in neural networks and cognitive science. Proposed by psychologist Donald Hebb (1949), the rule is often summarized as:

“Neurons that fire together, wire together.”

Hebbian learning is an unsupervised learning algorithm that strengthens the connection (weight) between two neurons if they are activated simultaneously. This concept models how the human brain learns associations and patterns from repeated experiences.

Through this project, the Hebbian learning mechanism is implemented to:

Understand biologically inspired learning principles

Observe how weight updates occur based on neuron co-activation

Visualize how simple networks can learn input-output associations without explicit error correction

The project demonstrates how the weight matrix evolves during training, highlighting the foundation upon which modern learning algorithms (like perceptron learning and backpropagation) are built.
